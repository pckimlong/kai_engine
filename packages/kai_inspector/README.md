The Final Flow

  1. The Two-Package Structure

   * `kai_engine` (The Core): A lean, platform-agnostic package. It contains all the core logic for chat processing. It knows that it can be inspected, but it doesn't
     know how.
   * `kai_inspector` (The Tool): A new Flutter package that developers can optionally add to their dev_dependencies. It contains all the UI and default logic for the
     Inspector tool.

  2. The "Contract" in `kai_engine`

  To allow the kai_inspector to plug in, kai_engine will define the "contract" (the API) for the inspection system. This contract consists of two parts:

   * The Data Models: kai_engine will define the data structures that represent an execution: TimelineSession, ExecutionTimeline, TimelinePhase, and TimelineStep.
   * The Service Interface: kai_engine will define a single abstract class. This is the main plug-in point for the entire system.

   1     // Defined in kai_engine
   2     abstract class KaiInspector {
   3       // The public API for the inspection system
   4     }

  3. The Developer's Experience

  This is how a developer will use the system in their app:

   * Step A (Optional): In their pubspec.yaml, they add kai_inspector to their dev_dependencies.
   * Step B: They create an instance of the Inspector service. The kai_inspector package will provide a default, in-memory implementation.
   1     // In the developer's app setup code
   2     final inspector = DefaultKaiInspector();
   * Step C (Injection): They pass this instance into the kai_engine's main controller.

   1     final chatController = ChatController(
   2       // ... other services
   3       inspector: inspector, // Injecting the service
   4     );
      If they pass nothing (inspector: null), a default NoOpInspector is used internally, and the entire feature is disabled with zero performance cost.
   * Step D (UI): In their app's debug screen, they use the pre-built widget from the kai_inspector package, passing it the same instance.
   1     // In the developer's debug UI
   2     KaiInspectorScreen(inspector: inspector);

  4. The Internal Engine Flow

  Hereâ€™s what happens inside kai_engine when the developer calls chatController.submit():

   1. The ChatController checks if it was given a KaiInspector instance.
   2. It tells the inspector: "A new message is being processed for session 'XYZ'. Here is the timeline object that you should update."
   3. The ChatController then executes its pipeline of KaiPhases (QueryEngine, GenerationService, etc.).
   4. As each KaiPhase runs, it uses the built-in withStep() helper, which creates TimelineStep data objects.
   5. When a phase is complete, the ChatController takes the resulting TimelinePhase data object (which contains all its steps) and hands it to the inspector service.
   6. The inspector service receives this data and adds it to the ExecutionTimeline for the current message. It then broadcasts the updated timeline on its public
      Stream.

  5. The UI Reactivity

   1. The KaiInspectorScreen widget is listening to the Stream from the KaiInspector service instance it was given.
   2. When the service broadcasts the updated timeline, the StreamProvider (or similar mechanism) inside the KaiInspectorScreen receives the new data.
   3. The screen automatically rebuilds itself to display the new information, showing the steps and phases as they complete in near real-time.

  This creates a clean, decoupled, and highly extensible end-to-end flow that is easy for developers to opt into and use.
